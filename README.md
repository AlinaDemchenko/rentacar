This web application has been developed using React, along with technologies such as react-redux toolkit, Tailwind CSS, REST API, react-router-dom, axios, and various other libraries. The website serves as a car rental service platform, offering user-friendly filtering options and the ability to save selected cars. The application is currently in the development phase, with the desktop version being the only one implemented so far. Therefore, it is recommended to view the application on devices with a screen width of 1280px or more. The author also made efforts to address the merging issues between the master and git-hub-pages branches, but by the deadline, the only solution reached was to discontinue the use of git-hub-pages and instead deploy all future React applications on Vercel.
